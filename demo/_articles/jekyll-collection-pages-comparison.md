## Conclusion

It's particularly powerful for sites with diverse content types that need a unified system for content organization.

jekyll-tagging remains a solid choice for blogs focused on tag-based navigation, especially if you want features like tag clouds. jekyll-category-pages is best suited for sites that primarily use categories and don't require tag functionality.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your specific needs. Consider your site structure, the importance of tags vs categories, and whether you need to organize content beyond just blog posts when making your decision.

Remember, you can always start with a simpler solution and migrate to a more comprehensive one as your site grows and your needs evolve.
